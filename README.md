# ggplot2

ggplot2 is data visualization package in R programming that can be used to make different kind of plot. In R studio, library(ggplot2) can be used to load the package.

The data set used is comparing the transcript profiles from peripheral B lymphocytes between patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and normal healthy controls.Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with an important clinical and biological heterogeneity. B lymphocytes appear central to the development of SLE which is characterized by the production of a large variety of autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia. In mice, immature B cells from spontaneous lupus prone animals are able to produce autoantibodies when transferred into immunodeficient mice, strongly suggesting the existence of intrinsic B cell defects during lupus. In order to approach these defects in humans, we compared the peripheral B cell transcriptomes of quiescent lupus patients to normal B cell transcriptomes.

For this analysis, ggplot package was used to create a plot such as gene_profile plot, scatter plot in Rstudio. The dataset is available to download.
